# Abstract
This game was created to showcase some 3D models and experiment with gameplay mechanics. The laser rifle was modeled in Maya, along with the enemies.
The objective of the game is simply to get to the end and to survive. You must destroy the enemies with your laser rifle, equipped with two firing modes.
Two grueling levels stand between you and victory.
